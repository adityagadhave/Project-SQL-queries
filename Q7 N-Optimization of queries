/* To optimize this query without changing the table structure or adding indexes,
we can rewrite the query to avoid sorting the entire table. Instead of sorting the entire table by Water_Temperature and then returning the top 10 results, 
we can use a subquery to first identify the top 10 values of Water_Temperature and then join that result back to the original table to retrieve the corresponding rows. */
