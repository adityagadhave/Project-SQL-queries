To optimize this query, I have dcreate an index on the Water_Temperature column. 
This will allow the database to more efficiently sort the data based on the Water_Temperature values, resulting in faster execution time.

CREATE INDEX water_temperature_idx ON water_data (Water_Temperature);

SELECT
  Date,
  Time,
  Water_Temperature
FROM
  water_data
ORDER BY
  Water_Temperature DESC
LIMIT 10;
